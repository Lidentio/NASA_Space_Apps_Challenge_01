🌌 NASA Picture of the Day Viewer
🚀 Project Overview

The NASA Picture of the Day Viewer is a simple and interactive web app that displays NASA’s Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) using NASA’s public API.
Users can view the image (or video) for any selected date and read its scientific description — all in a clean, minimal interface.

This project was built as part of the NASA Space Apps Challenge to promote public access to space data and inspire curiosity about our universe.
